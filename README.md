# **K-Means Clustering on an Image**
## Project Description
Question 1 of Homework 4 required running K-Means on a given image titled `image.png`, and running our experiments of clustering the image with K values as 2, 4, 7 and 10. The question also specifies the initial centroids, and requires the clusters to be recolored with the given RGB values. In the ZIP file `devika_chandnani_CS5790_HW4.zip` you will find the code along with `image.png`. They are required to be in the same directory for the code to funciton. 
 
## Operating Environment
Python 3.9.6 64-bit // Jupyter Notebooks

## Implementation and Execution
1. Open up your virtual environment, Jupyter Notebook and select a Python interpreter. 
2. Change working directory to the folder where `devika_chandnani_CS5790_HW4.ipynb` and the image named `image.png` are stored.
3. The project requires **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **sklearn** and **matplotlib** libraries, the first block of code imports them.
4. Run all the blocks of code all at once, the Kmeans algorithm will print the final SSE for each K value and plot the clustered image.  

## Output

Running the Jupyter Notebook file below will result in the following files as output: 
1. Running the block of code where n = 2 will save the output image `k2.png` in the working directory.
2. Running the block of code where n = 4 will save the output image `k4.png` in the working directory.
3. Running the block of code where n = 4 will save the output image `k7.png` in the working directory.
4. Running the block of code where n = 4 will save the output image `k10.png` in the working directory.
